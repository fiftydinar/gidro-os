# This file utilizes user configuration of `tracked initramfs arguments` used by the `initramfs-setup` BlueBuild module.
# If this file is not modified, the image's default configuration will be used instead (located in /usr/share/bluebuild/initramfs-setup/tracked).
# This config uses the file location format, with one file location per line.
# Duplicated entries won't be used if located in the image's default configuration.
# Don't forget to copy your initramfs modification files if you have those.
# Here's an example on how to edit this file (ignore # symbol):
#
# /etc/vconsole.conf
# /etc/crypttab
# /etc/modprobe.d/my-modprobe.conf
