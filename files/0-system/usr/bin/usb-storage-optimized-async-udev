# udev rule for usb-storage-optimized-async

# Limit the amount of disk cache for USB storage devices, to ensure that writing speed is correct, as opposed to async
# sync is too slow & has a risk for deteorating USB storage data health, so that's why this balanced solution is being done
# See the link below for more details
# https://github.com/ublue-os/packages/issues/677
